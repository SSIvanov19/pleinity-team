  <h1>💻 About  </h1>
  <p>
    Introducing our solution to the world - using AI to manage water in water sources used for providing water to cities and villages. 
  </p>
  <h1>🎥 Demo of our project </h1>

  <h1>⌨️ How it works</h1>
  <p><big>Our work can be split on 3 main things :</p></big>
  <ol>
    <li>📊 The Data Set : </li>
    <ul>
    <li>The Data Set is the most important thing of the entire project. It helps the algorithm predict the future outcome.</li>
    <li>Our current Data Set has information for around 4000 days. It is stored in the Data/ 📁 folder. It depends on you if your algorithm will be more efficient than ours - you just need more Data.</li>
    <li>We are currently using a <img src="images/excel-logo.png" width="18px" height="18px" alt="excel" > <strong> .csv </strong> file  as it is optimised for large amounts of data, but you can try with <strong> .xslx </strong>  or <strong> .sql </strong> files.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
    <img src="https://emoji.gg/assets/emoji/py.png" width="18px" height="18px" alt="py" > The Python Application :  </li>
    <ul><li>Our main application and idea are written in Python, with the help of a few AI modules. </li> 
   <li> The application asks for your input - the amount of days you want to predict. </li>
   <li>It is stored in the Data Analysis 📁 folder, which is a subfolder of Data Manipulation 📁. </li>
   <li> It uses 2 algorithms for calculating the predictions - Decision Tree and Linear Regression. </li>
   <li>After getting your input, you will have 3 files in your Data Visualisation Folder -<strong> basic_model.png </strong>, <strong>decision_tree_prediction.png</strong>
   and <strong>linear_regression_prediction.png</strong>.</li>
   </ul>
   <li><img src="https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logos-brands-5/24/unity-512.png" width="18px" height="18px" alt="py"> The Unity Simulation : </li>
   <ul>
   <li>Its purpose is to show how the AI will act in situations where the Storage is in critical levels. </li>
   <li>It is made in Unity and the 3D models are made in Blender.</li>
   <li>And a few screenshots of it :</li>
